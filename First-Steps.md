# C# First Steps
### Write your first C# code
What is the primary job of the compiler?
- The compiler primarily converts your code into an executable format that the computer can understand.
C# statements must always end in a colon. ;

What is a literal value?
- A literal value is a hard-coded value that never changes. Previously, we displayed a literal string to the Output pane. In other words, we literally wanted that string of alphanumeric characters H, e, l, l, o, and so on, displayed in the Output window.
- * Write a char literal to the console... *
  - ```Console.WriteLine('b');```
- * Write a char literal to the console... *
  - ```Console.WriteLine('123');```
- * Write a char decimal to the cons... *
  - ```Console.WriteLine('12.30m');```
  - (Without the literal suffix m, the decimal number in the previous example will be treated as type double by the compiler and the output will be 12.3.)
